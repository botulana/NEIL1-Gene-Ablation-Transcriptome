# Ablation of the NEIL1 Gene Alters the Transcriptome of Htert RPE-1 Cells

## Master's Thesis Project

This repository contains the code, data analysis scripts, and relevant materials from my masterâ€™s thesis titled: **"Ablation of the NEIL1 Gene Alters the Transcriptome of Htert RPE-1 Cells."** This project explores the molecular and transcriptional consequences of NEIL1 gene knockout in human retinal pigment epithelial (Htert RPE-1) cells.

## Overview

The NEIL1 gene is crucial for the base excision repair (BER) pathway and is known to protect cells from oxidative stress. This study aims to understand the transcriptomic changes that occur when the NEIL1 gene is ablated in Htert RPE-1 cells. The findings provide insights into the gene's role in maintaining genome integrity and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer.

The project combines RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, bioinformatics pipelines, and statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes and affected biological pathways.
